🚀 In React 19, the useTransition hook has been enhanced to support asynchronous functions, simplifying the management of state transitions involving async operations.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺: Managing asynchronous state updates often requires manual handling of loading states and error management, leading to verbose and error-prone code.

𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: With React 19, useTransition now supports async functions, allowing for automatic handling of pending states and errors within transitions.

𝗕𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲: Handling asynchronous state updates required explicit management of loading states and error handling.

𝗔𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗿: useTransition allows wrapping async functions, automatically managing pending states and errors. (𝘚𝘦𝘦 𝘪𝘮𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘥𝘦)

✅ Simplified Asynchronous Handling - Reduces boilerplate by automating the management of loading states and errors.

✅ Improved Readability: Cleaner and more maintainable code by leveraging async functions directly within transitions.
